# TaskManager
A simple C# console app to manage tasks using a Task class. Perfect for practicing OOP basics like encapsulation, properties, and constructor overloading.

# 📖 About
TaskManager lets you:

Create tasks with description, priority, and completion status.
Mark tasks as completed or not completed.
Display task details in a clean console output.
Built to master OOP in C#, focusing on encapsulation, properties, and clean code.

# 🚀 Features

Task Creation: Initialize tasks with description, priority (1–5), and completion status.
Input Checks: Validates description (non-empty) and priority (1–5).
Properties: Uses getters/setters for encapsulation, with read-only and computed properties.
Status Toggle: Mark tasks as completed/not completed with methods.
Computed Property: Displays priority level (High/Medium/Low) dynamically.

# 🛠️ How It Works

Create Task objects with different constructor options.
Use Complete or NotComplete to toggle task status.
Call Print to display task details (description, priority, status).
Console shows task info before and after status changes.

# 📋 Example Usage
Task: Write code, Priority: 1 (Low), Completed: False
Task: Fix bugs, Priority: 3 (Medium), Completed: False
Task: Deploy app, Priority: 5 (High), Completed: True
The task "Fix bugs" is complete!
Task: Fix bugs, Priority: 3 (Medium), Completed: True
